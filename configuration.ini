[directories]
'''
directories where the .tiff images are saved:
dirpath_tomo for tomographic projection
dirpath_flat for flat images
dirpath_dark for dark images

[angle]
'''
the last angle of the tomografic acquisition
'''
angle = 180

[outlier filter]
'''
the neighborhood radius considered in the outliers filtering.
The proper method replaces a pixel by the median of the pixels in the radius_neighborhood
if it deviates from the median by more than a certain value
'''
radius_neighborhood = 7 

[final files]
'''
dirpath_data is the folder where a .txt file will be saved. It contains the coordinates
of the ROI selected by the user and the computed values of the shift and the tilt angle 
of the axis of rotation with respect to the central vertical axis of the image.
filepath il the path with the prefix of the filename used to save the corrected images
(they will be in .tiff format and will be numerated with a certain number of digits
specified by the final variable digits
'''
